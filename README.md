# WoWDatabaseEditor
Editor for Smart Scripts for TrinityCore based servers.

This project is continuation of [Visual SAI Studio](https://github.com/BandyscLegacy/VisualSAIStudio), but rewritten from scratch. It is still in early stages, but anyone is welcome to help :-) Together we can make great wow emu editor!

You have to download [dbc data files](http://saistudio.tk/app/dbc.7z) and paste them in `WDE.DbcStore/dbc` to start the application (fix me!)
